According to their FAQ for RStudio users they “are committed to maintaining and updating RStudio. RStudio is very mature, stable software, and we intend to prioritize security, stability, priority bug fixes, and targeted improvements over an emphasis on sweeping novel feature development. Given our opportunity to make progress in parallel on a new platform, the bulk of large-scale, new features will go into Positron.”.\nFrom that, I would conclude that there is little point in learning software that is now essentially legacy and will not be actively improved. Therefore, I suggest you try Positron as soon as possible.\nIf you need a visual guide to Positron, depending on how much time you have you might like these videos:\n\n6 minutes: A quick tour of Positron by Sara Altman\n14 minutes: First look at Positron, exploring orca encounters by Julia Silge\n1 hour: R-Ladies Gaborone (EN) - Positron for RStudio Users: A Gentle Introduction by Isabella Velásquez\n\n\n\nOn macOS, the quickest way to install R and RStudio without manually downloading those, clicking and dragging, is to use the Homebrew package manager in the Terminal.app:\n# install R\nbrew install --cask r\n# note, if you install with `brew install r` (without --cask),\n# your R instalation is likely to install R packages from source, which takes a lot of time\n\n# install Positron\nbrew install --cask positron\n\n# install RStudio\nbrew install --cask rstudio\n\n\n\nYou do not actually have to install Quarto for this workshop or if you only use it inside RStudio or Positron, as they both bundle Quarto (RStudio since v2022.07). However, if at any point you will feel like you want a separate Quarto installation (e.g. you may want to manually run it outside of RStudio or Positron), you can do so here. The quarto R package is also completely optional (as it is just a wrapper around the Quarto command line tool), and can be installed with install.packages(\"quarto\") in RStudio/Positron.\n\n\n\n\nmacOSWindowsLinux\n\n\nThe best way to install git (and other software) on macOS is to use Homebrew package manager. Since you are already somewhat comfortable with R, and you are about to learn git, you will have to get comfortable with terminal commands anyway, as this is inevitable in the long term.\nThis may seem like a hassle, compared to Windows, but in the long run it will save you a lot of time after this one-time setup. You can follow the video here to guide you through the process, or the text instructions below.\n\n\n\n\nOpen details\n\n\nOpen the Terminal.app on your mac.\nGo to the Homebrew website https://brew.sh/.\nCopy whichever command they will have on the website under the “Install Homebrew” heading. This is one of the few occasions where you can trust the command you copy from a website to run in the Terminal. Running random commands from the internet is not safe. Always make sure you trust the website or person that is asking you to run any command in the Terminal.\n\nPress Enter and confirm with your password (in Terminal you do not see that you are typing your password, but actually you are). Same as above, make sure you trust whomever is telling you to confirm any terminal command with your password. Confirm again with Enter the installation of command line tools.\nWait for about 5 minutes.\nWhen the installation is complete, you should see the following:\n\n\n\nHomebrew is installed, follow the post-installation instructions by running the two commands you see in teh end of the output\n\n\nTo finilise the process, follow the post-installation instructions by running the two commands you see in the end of the output. The first command is unique to you, because it includes your username. However, you can also use these parametrised username-agnostic commands below ($(whoami) will be converted to your username when you run it):\n\nThis adds Homebrew to your terminal profile, so that the brew command is always available:\n\n(echo; echo 'eval \"$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"') &gt;&gt; /Users/$(whoami)/.zprofile\n\nThis does the same as above, but for the currently open terminal window, so that you do not have to restart it:\n\neval \"$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"\n\nNow you can install any software using commands in the terminal.\n\n\n\n\nOnce Homebrew is installed, open the Terminal.app on your mac and run the following command to install git:\nbrew install git\nAlso, for easier authentication, install the Git Credential Manager (GCM) using:\nbrew install --cask git-credential-manager\n\n\n\nGet git installer here and feel free to follow any of the multiple youtube videos on how to install git on Windows if you are stuck. This video is a good one. I recommend the choices that the author of the video selects during the installation. Among those choices, one of the most important one is to install the Git Credential Manager (GCM), which will allow you to authenticate with GitHub more easily.\n\n\nIf you are on Linux, you probably know what you are doing.

You may also find this video helpful.\nOverall the process is extremely simple, e.g. on Ubuntu you just run this in the terminal:\napt-get install git\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow the official instructions here to create a GitHub account.

Spatial aspect of the migration data\nApart from the histograms, scatterplots or other plots, it is also useful to look at your data on a map like so:\n\nshiny::tags$iframe(src = \"media/interactive/flowmap_widget.html\", width = \"100%\", height = \"600px\")\n\n\n\n\nThe data in the Scholarly Migration Database does not contain coordinates, but has country names and their ISO codes. So you can combine this data with some other datasource that coordinates or boundaries for countries and their ISO codes.\n\n3.1 Packages for spatial data and flow mapping\nHere is a list of packages that you need to map the migration data:\n\npackages &lt;- c(\n  \"sf\", # for working with spatial data\n  \"spData\", # to easily get world boundaires\n  \"countrycode\", # to convert between iso2 and iso3 country codes\n  \"flowmapblue\", # for interactive flow mapping\n  \"flowmapper\" # for static flow mapping using ggplot2\n  )\ninstall.packages(packages)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou only need to install the packages once, do not keep the code to install the packages in your Quarto document, at least not as it is presented above.

So if you keep this code in your Quarto document, the listed packages will be downloaded every time you render the document into html, pdf, or any other format. To learn more about package management in R, see the tutorials in Projects’ workflow for reproducibility and replicability using R.\n\n\n\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(spData)\nlibrary(countrycode)\nlibrary(flowmapblue)\nlibrary(flowmapper)\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\n3.2. How to prepare the data for flow mapping\nFor mapping the flows you will need the coorindates of the countries.\nAn easy way to create these coordinates is by getting the data on country boundaries from the {spData} package:\n\ncountries &lt;- spData::world\nglimpse(countries)\n\nRows: 177\nColumns: 11\n$ iso_a2    &lt;chr&gt; \"FJ\", \"TZ\", \"EH\", \"CA\", \"US\", \"KZ\", \"UZ\", \"PG\", \"ID\", \"AR\", …\n$ name_long &lt;chr&gt; \"Fiji\", \"Tanzania\", \"Western Sahara\", \"Canada\", \"United Stat…\n$ continent &lt;chr&gt; \"Oceania\", \"Africa\", \"Africa\", \"North America\", \"North Ameri…\n$ region_un &lt;chr&gt; \"Oceania\", \"Africa\", \"Africa\", \"Americas\", \"Americas\", \"Asia…\n$ subregion &lt;chr&gt; \"Melanesia\", \"Eastern Africa\", \"Northern Africa\", \"Northern …\n$ type      &lt;chr&gt; \"Sovereign country\", \"Sovereign country\", \"Indeterminate\", \"…\n$ area_km2  &lt;dbl&gt; 19289.97, 932745.79, 96270.60, 10036042.98, 9510743.74, 2729…\n$ pop       &lt;dbl&gt; 885806, 52234869, NA, 35535348, 318622525, 17288285, 3075770…\n$ lifeExp   &lt;dbl&gt; 69.96000, 64.16300, NA, 81.95305, 78.84146, 71.62000, 71.039…\n$ gdpPercap &lt;dbl&gt; 8222.2538, 2402.0994, NA, 43079.1425, 51921.9846, 23587.3375…\n$ geom      &lt;MULTIPOLYGON [°]&gt; MULTIPOLYGON (((-180 -16.55..., MULTIPOLYGON ((…\n\n\nSo this spatial data is just like a regular data.frame/tibble, but with an extra column with geometry data. Therefore, you can plot this data using ggplot2:\n\ncountries |&gt; \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_sf()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also include several layers in the same plot:\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = countries) +\n  geom_sf(data = st_point_on_surface(countries), color = \"darkred\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor flow mapping, you only need one point per country, so you only need a center (or more formally a ‘centroid’, but st_point_on_surface() function produces a special kind of centroid that is guaranteed to be placed on the polygon surface and never placed outside irregularly shaped polygon) of each country’s polygon. Here is how you can do it:\n\ncountries_centroids &lt;- countries |&gt; \n  st_centroid() |&gt; # finds a center of each country'spolygon\n  st_coordinates() |&gt;  # extracts numeric coorindates from the POINT geometry\n  as.data.frame() |&gt; # converts the matrix to a data.frame \n  setNames(c(\"lon\", \"lat\")) |&gt; # renames the columns\n  cbind(countries) |&gt; # adds back all the columns (except for geometry) form `countries`\n  select(iso_a2, lon, lat, name_long) # only selects a few columns that we really need\n\nglimpse(countries_centroids)\n\nRows: 177\nColumns: 4\n$ iso_a2    &lt;chr&gt; \"FJ\", \"TZ\", \"EH\", \"CA\", \"US\", \"KZ\", \"UZ\", \"PG\", \"ID\", \"AR\", …\n$ lon       &lt;dbl&gt; 178.56842, 34.74198, -12.18574, -96.39551, -103.57290, 67.23…\n$ lat       &lt;dbl&gt; -17.3156217, -6.2505643, 24.2783849, 60.4767578, 44.7559814,…\n$ name_long &lt;chr&gt; \"Fiji\", \"Tanzania\", \"Western Sahara\", \"Canada\", \"United Stat…\n\n\nYou may freely reuse this code above in your Quarto report.\nThe data format you get is ideal for both {flowmapblue} and {flowmapper} packages. You only need to tweak the column names of the countries_centroids data.frame before using it with either of these packages. You can see relevant package documentation for more details. Alternatively, you can follow tutorials for {flowmapper} and {flowmapblue}.\n\n\n3.3. Country codes\nYou will find that the country code data in the Scholarly Migration Database does not match with the country names in the countries data.frame. Scholarly migration database uses ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes, and countrycode uses the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes. So you need to convert the country names in the countries data.frame to ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes.\nYou can do this conversion using the countrycode package like so:\n\nlibrary(countrycode)\n\n# assuming your data.frame is called `scopus_country_flows`\nscopus_country_flows &lt;- scopus_country_flows |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    iso2codefrom = countrycode(iso3codefrom,\n      origin = \"iso3c\",\n      destination = \"iso2c\"),\n    iso2codeto = countrycode(iso3codeto,\n      origin = \"iso3c\",\n      destination = \"iso2c\")\n  )\n\n\n\n3.4. Hints on plotting the flows\n\n{flowmapper}\nTo plot the flows statically with {flowmapper}, you only need a regular code chunk, same as you would have for a ggplot2 plot.\nFeel free to adapt this tutorial, but use the Scholarly Migration Database data instead of the mobility data used there.\n\n\n{flowmapblue}\nTo create interactive flow maps with the {flowmapblue}, you will need a free MapBox account. Feel free to adapt this tutorial, but use the Scholarly Migration Database data instead of the mobility data used there.\nTo include the interactive plot with {flowmapblue}, you may need a somewhat more sophisticated code chunk. See the instructions below.\nIf you created an interactive flowmap like so:\n\nflowmap &lt;- flowmapblue(locations = locations, flows = flows, mapboxAccessToken = mapbox_access_token)\n\nBut simply printing the flowmap object in a code block breaks your entire Quarto document, here is what you need to do.\nSave the flowmap to an html file:\n\nhtmlwidgets::saveWidget(flowmap, \"flowmap.html\")\n\nThen include the html file in your Quarto document like so:\n\nlibrary(shiny)\nshiny::tags$iframe(src = \"flowmap_widget.html\", width = \"100%\", height = \"600px\")",

The name and email are public in git to attribute contributions to specific individuals, to ensure transparency and accountability. The email does not have to be the same email that you used to sign up for GitHub. It can even be a non-existing email. However this email will be publicly available. It will not be visible on the GitHub website, but anyone who clonse a public repository will be able to see it with a git log command:\n\n\n\nBeware that your name and email are public (viewed in terminal)\n\n\n\n\n\nBeware that your name and email are public (viewed in RStudio git history explorer)\n\n\n\n\n5.2. First commit\n\nPositronRStudio\n\n\nTo save your changes to the local git repository that you have open in Positron, find the Source Control panel on the left.\n\n\n\nGit panel in RStudio\n\n\nYou can select files that had changes or that were newly created or deleted. You can preview changes and select files that you want to save (commit) and later upload to GitHub (via Push). You can select one or more files to be staged, and only these files will be committed when you click the Commit button. Also, add a short comment to your commit dsecribing the changes, it will appear in the repository history.\n\n\n\nReview changes window in RStudio and commit\n\n\nAfter clicking the “Commit” button, the staged files will disappear from the list of changed files. You will then be able to Push the changes to GitHub.\n\n\n\nChanges commited, ready to Push\n\n\n\n\nTo save your changes to the local git repository that you have open in RStudio, find the Git panel in the top right and click the Diff button.\n\n\n\nGit panel in RStudio\n\n\nThis will open a new window where you can preview changes in the files that you made since last commit (which in this case was made by the author of the original repository, since you have just forked it).\n\n\n\nReview changes window in RStudio and commit\n\n\nHere you can select files that had changes or that were newly created or deleted. You can preview changes and select files that you want to save (commit) and later upload to GitHub (via Push). You can select one or more files to be staged, and only these files will be committed when you click the Commit button. Also, add a comment to your commit dsecribing the changes.\nAfter clicking the “Commit” button, you will see this screen.\n\n\n\nChanges commited\n\n\nClose this window and upload your commited changes to GitHub by clicking the “Push” button.\n\n\n\nCommit window in RStudio\n\n\nYou will see the upload screen:\n\n\n\nGit push window in RStudio\n\n\nYou can now close this window and the review changes window, and go to your GitHub repository to see the changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3. Publish the html file\nOnce you have an index.html file in the docs folder, you can go to the repository settings and publish it to the web.\n\n\n\nPublish via GitHub Pages\n\n\nYou will need to wait a few minutes. You only have one page, so it should not take too long. Reload the settings page and you should see your web link:\n\n\n\nWebsite published\n\n\nYou can also go to your repository homepage and add this link in the right side of the repository page:\n\n\n\nRepository view settings",

    "text": "Expected learning outcomes\n\nAble to use Quarto to create html documents with plain and markdown-formatted text and R code that produces tables, plots, or other outputs.\nAble to upload a project with reproducible analysis to GitHub using git.\nAble to collaborate on a project hosted on GitHub using Issues.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nStudents must have basic R training, including knowledge of the tidyverse for data manipulation and ggplot2 for data visualization, as well as familiarity with RStudio (as provided in the EDSD 140 Computer Programming for Demographers course). To participate in the workshop, we recommend that you have a GitHub account and have R, RStudio, and git installed. You can follow the setup instructions here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhile we are using GitHub for this workshop, mind you that there are alternative platforms for hosting code repositories, such as GitLab, Codeberg, Bitbucket, and others, including institutional git repositories (e.g. https://gitlab.uni-marburg.de/explore, https://git.univ-pau.fr/explore). The choice of platform often depends on personal preference, specific project requirements, or institutional guidelines. These platforms may offer slighly different features and web interfaces, but the underlying git functionalities remain consistent across them.\n\n\n\n\nRecommended readings\n\nHow to create a GitHub account: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github\nBrief intro to Quarto: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html\nQuarto documentation: https://quarto.org/docs/reference/\n\nQuarto is “an open-source scientific and technical publishing system” 1 that allows you to generate reproducible reports, websites, presentations and much more, by mixing plain text, simple markdown text formatting, and code. And not just R code, but also Python and Julia. The output format can be html, pdf, but also docx (if you really need it). You can also use addons/extensions to convert simple documents written in Quarto to publication ready pdfs using relevant templates.",
